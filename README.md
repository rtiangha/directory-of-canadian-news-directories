# Directory of Canadian News Directories
With [Bill C-18](https://www.parl.ca/legisinfo/en/bill/44-1/c-18) (which says digital companies must pay news organizations when someone gets to a web story through a link on one of their products) recently passed in Canada, there is a real danger that links to websites that host Canadian news may get delisted from search engines like Google for Canadians.

As of this writing, Meta has made the decision to block any news links from any outlet around the world from being posted or viewed on their various platforms, while Google has tested doing the same for a subset of Canadian users (however, they have yet to do so en masse).

While Canadians will still be able to access news websites directly, that's only useful if you know what a website's address is in the first place. If you don't, there's a danger that you may not easily be able to find that website via a web search in the future.

As it is less likely that search engines will block sites such as GitHub, this is a list of websites that host directories of Canadian news organizations in the hopes that this resource will remain findable on sites such as Google if those search organizations make the decision to delist Canadian news sites in the future.

Many organizations have already put the work into developing these directories, so rather than reinvent the wheel by creating yet another Canadian news website directory, it's easier just to link to the ones that already exist. By hosting this list on GitHub, it may also be easier for Canadians to share on websites such as Facebook as well.

This list is not exhaustive. If you feel that other directories should be included, then [Pull Requests](https://github.com/rtiangha/directory-of-canadian-news-directories/pulls) are welcome.
